# Decisions

## U1 — the user's ruling (verbatim), which is the whole premise

> Yes, registering a simulator (so that future Xschems see the "new" simulator
> instance) is something that can make it to disk right away as soon as done.
> But, registering a simulator is not part of the simulator state that
> accompanies a test-bench cell in the library manager.
>
> *Whether* the "new" simulator just registered gets assigned as "the one to
> use" is an option that is part of the ASE-L state. If changed, that results in
> dirtiness. User must explicitly save and, if user initiates an Xschem
> shutdown, then she must get a warning and a prompt to save.

This corrected a plan that would have autosaved the WHOLE registry, choice
included, on every mutation. Half of that plan was right (registration) and half
was exactly backwards (the choice).

## D1 — the choice is a state key, not a per-window global

`ase::sim_use` stays, but demoted to a cache of the active session's choice. The
store of record is the new `sim_entry` state key, which is what makes it dirty,
savable and promptable for free — `ase::session_dirty` already compares
serialized states, so no new dirty machinery is written.

Rejected: threading an entry name through `ase::sim_status`'s ten call sites.
None of them carries a session key, and the cost is a signature change in the
one resolver every simulator answer flows through.

## D2 — `{}` must mean "no choice", so "deliberately PATH" needs a spelling

104 committed `.state` files force the new key's default to be `{}` and force it
into `omit_if_empty` (the rule is already written at `src/ase.tcl:66` for `cosim`
and `save_op_params`). So `{}` cannot also mean "deliberately the PATH program",
which issue 0932 established is a real choice a user makes and must keep.
Chosen: a three-value encoding, `{}` / `none` / `{name <entry>}`. The two-word
form means no registry name has to be reserved.

Rejected: a reserved entry name (breaks an existing user's conf silently), and a
second boolean key (two keys for one fact breaks invariant I1).

## D3 — a `sim_select` from `conf` or `rc` is a DEFAULT, from `session` it is a CHOICE

This is how the saved file's default reaches `ase::sim_default` without changing
the file format at all: `ase::sim_origin` already distinguishes the three layers
and is already maintained. The existing `ase::sim_select {}` line that issue 0932
writes keeps meaning what it meant, on the default rather than on the choice.

## D4 — `ase::sim_clear` does not persist

*A mutation that expresses a user's choice persists; a teardown does not.*
`sim_clear` is "forget every registered simulator and every choice". Autosaving
there would let a test or a script blank the user's list — the one way an
autosave-at-the-mutation design can destroy data.

## D5 — carried limitation, NOT fixed here (owed as a `rule`)

Two ASE-L windows open on different test benches still share one `ase::sim_use`.
The run path applying the running session's `sim_entry` makes "the window you
clicked in wins" for the run, which is the half that decides what actually
executes. A bar or dialog in the other window may momentarily name the other
choice. Per-window registries are a separate feature and were not asked for.
