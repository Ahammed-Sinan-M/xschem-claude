# test_sim_casemode_registry.tcl — CASE MODE AS A PROPERTY OF THE REGISTERED
# SIMULATOR. Written at the `annotate` merge; it is the surviving half of
# test_sim_profiles.tcl and test_sim_dialog.tcl, which are retired beside it.
#
# WHAT CHANGED, AND WHAT DID NOT. `fluid-editing`'s casemode batch item 6 put the
# requested case mode -- and the exe, the args and the `-n` flag -- on a
# simulator PROFILE, a row of the stock `sim()` array; item 13 gave every row a
# second dialog line to edit them. `annotate` shipped a simulator REGISTRY with
# CRUD, validation, capability probing and a saved list that survives a restart,
# and the user ruled that the registry wins. Two stores describing one machine is
# not a richer configuration, it is one that can disagree with itself: nothing
# kept the case mode on a `sim()` row and the program in the registry talking
# about the same binary, and nothing invalidated either when the other changed.
#
# ⚠ EVERY RULING BELOW IS THE SAME RULING IT ALWAYS WAS. Only the storage moved.
# The rows are named for the checks they descend from so the lineage is
# followable:
#
#   A1  nobody may select a mode their simulator will silently ignore. The
#       selectable set is exactly what was MEASURED; an unmeasured program offers
#       `fold` alone, `fold` being what a released ngspice does whether or not it
#       was asked (it accepts `-D casemode=preserve` and ignores it, measured).
#   B1  per simulator, with a global floor: a simulator with no request of its
#       own takes `$::sim_case_mode`, which the user sets once for all of them.
#   B2b an unmeasured program is UNKNOWN, never a claim.
#
# WHAT IS NOT HERE, deliberately: the PROBE itself (test_sim_probe), the run
# command it composes (test_sim_run_profile), the C netlister bridge
# (test_sim_plain_run), the capability cache's own contract
# (test_ase_simcaps_0948), and the pick path (test_ase_sod_case).
#
# Run TRUE HEADLESS from the repo root (needs no display):
#   ./src/xschem --nogui --pipe -q --nolog --script tests/headless/test_sim_casemode_registry.tcl

# ISSUE 1239, THE OTHER DIRECTION -- A `$` MUST NOT SURVIVE INTO A FILENAME.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The rows above measure the LOOSENING the hardening was for: shapes the old
# `subst -nocommands` accepted (and executed) are now refused. This block
# measures the direction the first pass missed, and it was found by a
# differential fuzz, not by reading: shapes the OLD expander RAISED on came back
# from the new one SILENTLY, as a literal, with the dollar sign still in the
# path. A model path that used to fail loudly at load became a filename with a
# `$` in it, which fails later, somewhere else, with a worse message.
#
# TWO MECHANISMS, and both are in the parser rather than in any one shape:
#
#   M1 NO MATCH AT ALL -> the `$` was emitted as a literal and the scan moved on.
#      Tcl's own parser, though, DOES read `$(idx)` (a variable whose name is
#      empty), `${}`, an unterminated brace form, and a bare `$::` as
#      references, and raises on every one of them.
#   M2 A SHORTER MATCH THAN TCL'S -> the reference expanded and the REMAINDER
#      became literal text. `$V::` gave `<value>::`, `$V(` gave `<value>(`,
#      where Tcl read the name `V::` / an unterminated index and raised.
#
# So the expander now refuses at exactly the two seams: a `$` it declined that
# Tcl would have read (a brace form, a `(`, or a `::` run), and a name it
# stopped short of that Tcl would have continued (`::` or `(` right after).
#
# ⚠ `$` IS STILL A LITERAL WHERE TCL LEAVES IT ONE -- CS157z. `$/x`, `$$V`, a
# trailing `$`, `$V:x` (ONE colon ends a name for Tcl too) all still pass
# through, because tightening those would refuse paths that both expanders
# always accepted and no defect was ever reported about.
# Helpers for the block below. `cs157_refusals` names every shape that came back
# with a VALUE where a refusal was wanted, so a red row says which shape and what
# it returned instead of just "0 != 1".
